    "\n",
    "For the initial set of features for \\( X \\), I chose the housing prices (`PRICE`) from the New York Housing dataset. Higher housing prices may indicate more affluent areas with better living conditions, while lower prices may suggest less desirable or lower-income neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the target feature \\( y \\), I selected the count of rat sightings (`Sightings Count`) from the Rat Sightings dataset. Higher counts of rat sightings may suggest poorer sanitation and hygiene practices, which could potentially affect the desirability and perceived value of properties in the vicinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "By examining the relationship between housing prices and the count of rat sightings, we can explore potential correlations and patterns between socio-economic factors and public health concerns in different neighborhoods of New York City."
