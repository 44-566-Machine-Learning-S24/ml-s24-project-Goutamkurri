In this case, the RMSE is very high, suggesting that the model's predictions deviate significantly from the actual house prices in the training set.\n",

    "3. **R^2 Score (Coefficient of Determination)**: R^2 score measures the proportion of the variance in the target variable that is predictable from the features. A higher R^2 score closer to 1 indicates a better fit of the model to the data. However, the R^2 score here is very low (0.015), suggesting that the model explains only a small fraction of the variance in the target variable and performs poorly in capturing the relationships between features and house prices.\n",

Further analysis and potentially more sophisticated modeling techniques may be necessary to improve the model's performance."
